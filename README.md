# hello-world
This is my first repository. Hello world!
I've been messing around with Python for a little while now, but I have not actually done anything with it up until today. I am planning on seriously working on some stuff, at least some very basic Python programs to enrich this place. And right now, I'm reading the "hello-world" document from GitHub, so I just learned how to branch a repository.
